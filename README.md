# about the two versions
1.  The google play version is prepared for users who can use google play normally, and is consistent with the version on google play
2. The Alipay version is prepared for users in China. It connects to Alipay for face-to-face payment, and then can be updated in the app, except that the function is the same as the Google play version
(alipay版本为中国的用户准备，它接入了支付宝面对面支付，然后可以在应用内更新，除此之外功能和google play版本是一样的)
